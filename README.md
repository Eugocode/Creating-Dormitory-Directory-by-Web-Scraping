# Centralized Dorm Directory - A Web-Scraped Directory

Creating Manila Dormitory Directory by scraping data from the web.

Find the best Manila Dormitory for you! If you’re a student attending school in Manila, chances are you will need to find a place to stay. Dormitories are a popular option for many students, as they offer a sense of community and support that can be hard to come by when living on your own. But with so many dormitories to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. That’s why we’ve put together this comprehensive guide for your best dormitory in Manila. Read on to learn more!

## About the project:

Student or workers often face challenges in finding suitable dormitory accommodations in Manila due to limited centralized information available online. The absence of a comprehensive database forces students to spend more time searching for dormitory options across various websites. With this being said, collecting dormitory data would help dormitory seekers to easily access comprehensive information about available dormitory accomodations in Manila in just one database.

## Potential Improvements:

At this moment, the collected data are on its initial stage. Only few dormitories are listed. With this regular updates are needed. Also, data validation and cleaning should be done to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the scraped information. On the next stages of this project, user-friendly interface or application can be created where students can search, filter, and compare dormitory options more effectively.
