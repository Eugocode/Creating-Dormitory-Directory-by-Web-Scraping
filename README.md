## About the project:

Student or workers often face challenges in finding suitable dormitory accommodations in Manila due to limited centralized information available online. The absence of a comprehensive database forces students to spend more time searching for dormitory options across various websites. With this being said, collecting dormitory data would help dormitory seekers to easily access comprehensive information about available dormitory accomodations in Manila in just one database.

## Potential Improvements:

At this moment, the collected data are on its initial stage. Only few dormitories are listed. With this regular updates are needed. Also, data validation and cleaning should be done to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the scraped information. On the next stages of this project, user-friendly interface or application can be created where students can search, filter, and compare dormitory options more effectively.
